//FIRST TYPE
/* arithmentic operators (Concatenate numbers and strings)
 =, +, /, *,
    example:
        var now = "Now In "
        var three = 3
        var d = 'D!'
        console.log(now + three + d);
    answer: Now In 3D!
comparison operators
<, >, !=, ==, 
logical operators
and &&, example a>5 && a<10
! not
|| or
//NEXT TYPE:
Logical AND operator (ampersand &): && 
Logical OR operator: || 
Logical NOT operator: ! 
The modulus operator: % 
    (example: answer depends on how many times does 6 go into 12.
    12%6 
    answer: 0 because 6 goes into 12 2 times with no remanders
    14%6
    answer: 2 because 2 is the remainder)
The equality operator: ==
The strict equality operator: ===
        equal to value first and type second
The inequality operator: !=
The strict inequality operator: !==
        does not equal value or type
The addition and concatenation assignment operator: += 
        example:
        var counter = 0
        counter +=5
        counter +=3
        console.log(counter);
    answer: 8

/*
Create a variable named  score and set it to  8
Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator
The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".
*/
//answer
/*
var score = 8
console.log("mid-level skills:", score>0 && score<10);
*/
//answer: mid-level skills: true
/*
var timeRemaining = 0
var energy = 10
console.log("game over", + timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0)
*/
//answer: game over true
